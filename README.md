## Validator Operator Setup Guide

Validator operators can add their contact information, icon, and which validators they operate, to the dashboardâ€™s Community section. The Community feature is designed to give non-biased exposure to validator operators, and to host a fully-featured validator browser just for that operator's validators.

To add an operator, submit a PR with the following changes:

- **Thumbnail:** Add your operator's thumbnail as an SVG Component in [this folder](https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin-staking-dashboard/tree/main/src/config/validators/thumbnails).
- **Operator details:** Add your operator details to the `VALIDATORS_COMMUNITY`JSON object in [this file](https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin-staking-dashboard/blob/main/src/config/validators/index.ts).

### Operator Structure

The following table outlines the structure of a `ValidatorCommunity` entry:

### Example Operator

Upload your SVG icon as a React component. Look at the existing icons as examples, or use the [SVGR Playground](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) to convert your raw SVG file into a component.

Next, add your operator details to the `ValidatorCommunity` object. Only provide the validator(s) for the particular network(s) you are operating in.

The following example defines 2 validators on the Creditcoin Mainnet, and 1 on the Creditcoin Testnet:

```typescript
export const ValidatorCommunity = [
  ...
  {
    name: 'Validator Central',
    thumbnail: 'ValidatorCentral',
    bio: 'Summing up my validator identity in a sentence or so. Maximum 300 characters.',
    email: 'validatorcentral@parity.io',
    twitter: '@ParityTech',
    website: 'https://parity.io',
    validators: {
      creditcoin: [
      '1hYiMW8KSfUYChzCQSPGXvMSyKVqmyvMXqohjKr3oU5PCXF',
      '14QSBoJMHF2Zn2XEoLNSeWgqBRr8XoKPy4BxToD6yLSeFFYe'
      ],
      creditcoinTest: ['FykhnPA3pn269LAcQ8VQKDgUQ8ieAaSLwJDhAVhu3dcokVR'],
    },
  },
  ...
];

```
